To access the api key i created config.toml file and saved the api_key

First splitting the entire pdf text into chunks and then converting them to vectors

If you want to save the vectors you can use vectorstores for storing i have used FAISS for temporary storage, if you want permanent storage of those vectors you can create a .faiss file which stores all the vectors and increases efficiency in answer retrieval 

Fetching 50 relevant sentences and out of those only 8 most relevant sentences will be sent to openai as context to answer the questions and to increase cost efficiency

Put the openai api key in config.toml

After doing pip install -r requirements.txt
Run streamlit run main.py
